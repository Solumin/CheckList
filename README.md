# PyChecklist
## Its the final CheckList
### A 'written in python for python' program in Python/GTK, using YAML for storage. Aimed at non-mobile users.


## This program will have three components:
1. The checklist engine
2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) version
3. Command Line Utility (CLU)

The GUI and the CL will both use the engine as their underlying method of performance and will read the same files. The actual checklists will be stored in YAML files for readability.


## Update
1. Updated format and layout of PyChecklist
2. Renamed CheckList to PyChecklist for clarity.
3. Updated print statements with parenthesis's
3. Monkey patched an import statement and it works.
